! Section 2: terse errors
FormatConstants.CUFProperty.InvalidCUFPropertyIndex=\
    No such CUF property: not a valid index: %1$d
WrappedSource.WrappedInvalidError=\
    Argument CUFSource is not read/prepared: %1$s
MixedSource.MixedContainsError=\
    This font already contains the given CUF Source: %1$s
MixedSource.MixedInvalidError=\
    Argument CUFSource is not read/prepared: %1$s
MixedSource.MixedListsLengthError=\
    Argument lists are not of the same length (source fonts: %1$d, mix mode flags: %2$d).
MixedSource.MixedArgumentNullError=\
    Found a null element (index: %1$d) in argument list of type: %2$s.
# error when the user provides two characters to represent a range of characters,
# but the `lower' bound is not in fact lower than the `upper' bound.
RestrictedSource.InvalidCharRange=\
    Invalid character range: %1$s (start) is \u2018larger\u2019 than %2$s (end).
# error when the user provides a list of
# character values to be used as substitute for the given list of keys for a certain font,
# but the values are too few to cover all the keys.
MappedSource.TooFewEntriesError=\
    Mismatch between keys and values: too few values or no keys. Found: %1$d keys; but only: %2d corresponding values.
WrappedSource.AlgorithmSource.LeftOverChars=\
    Fixing chartable compatibility for \u201c%1$s\u201d caused some characters to be discarded.
